I'm happy to announce the immeadiate availability of our latest FreeSewing pattern: [the Hortensia handbag](/designs/hortensia/).

Hortensia's origin story traces back to [@stofsutchti](https://twitter.com/stoffsuchti) who wanted to create a pattern for a handbag, and was looking for somebody who could implement that design in code.

It was [Wouter](https://github.com/woutervdub) who answered the call and implemented the pattern, making this another success story from the FreeSewing community.

## No measurements needed

This is the first pattern on FreeSewing that does not require any measurements to make. There's some options you can choose — to control the size of the handbag for one thing — but since this is a handbag, no measurements are needed.

This makes Hortensia a great project to make as a gift, since there's no need to worry about fit.
